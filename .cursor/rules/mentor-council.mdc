# Mentor council (auto + on-demand)

Apply the `mentor-council` skill when discussing **product definition, strategy, roadmap, architecture, priorities, trade-offs, or key decisions**.

Auto-trigger cues (non-exhaustive):
- The user mentions: PRD, strategy, roadmap, milestone, narrative, positioning, pricing, go-to-market
- The user mentions: SPEC, ADR, architecture boundary, invariants, security/privacy, on-disk format
- The user asks: "批判性评价/审查/取舍/优先级/最优方案/应该怎么做"

Constraints:
- Never impersonate real people. Treat "Jobs/Musk/Linus" as **lenses**, not identities.
- Be specific: name decisions, risks, and next actions.

Default verbosity:
- If the user did not explicitly request a deep review, output **Council verdict + 1 lens** (pick the most relevant).
- If the user requests a deep review, or the decision is high-impact/irreversible, output the **full multi-lens** template.
