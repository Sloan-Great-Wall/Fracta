# OPTIONAL: Local Cargo configuration for macOS development
#
# Copy this file to .cargo/config.toml if you encounter build issues
# related to missing SDK or compiler paths (common when xcode-select
# points to CommandLineTools instead of Xcode.app).
#
# This file is NOT committed to git (.cargo/config.toml is in .gitignore)
# because it contains machine-specific paths.
#
# Usage:
#   cp .cargo/config.toml.example .cargo/config.toml
