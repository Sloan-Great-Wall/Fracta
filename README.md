# Fracta

A **local-first personal data workbench**: manage files like Finder, organize with database-like views, use AI to move projects forward and produce reviews/archives, and optionally support cryptographic / blockchain proofs for attribution and incentives.

This repository is currently in the **software definition / design phase** (docs-only; no implementation code yet).
